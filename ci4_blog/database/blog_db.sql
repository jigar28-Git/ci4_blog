Within the paper, the Federal Reserve commented on the need for extreme resiliency to cybersecurity threats on any proposed CBDC system. Among the benefits to adopting a CBDC listed is to both support the dollar’s international role, and improve cross border payments, however, to achieve the latter requires significant international co-operation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=\\&quot;font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.75rem; color: rgb(29, 37, 44); margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 18px; margin-left: 0px; font-family: Hoves, Arial, sans-serif; letter-spacing: -0.1px; clear: left; font-stretch: normal !important;\\&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=\\&quot;font-size: 1.125rem !important; line-height: 1.75rem !important; font-stretch: normal !important;\\&quot;&gt;Turning to cybersecurity news within cryptocurrencies this month, Crypto.com admitted that login issues that had plagued users turned out to be a&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=\\&quot;font-size: 1.125rem !important; line-height: 1.75rem !important; font-stretch: normal !important;\\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=\\&quot;https://www.vice.com/en/article/g5qj9j/cryptocom-says-incident-was-actually-dollar30-million-hack\\&quot; rel=\\&quot;nofollow\\&quot; style=\\&quot;color: rgb(48, 115, 102); text-decoration-line: none; font-size: 1.125rem; line-height: 1.4; font-stretch: normal !important;\\&quot;&gt;$30 million dollar hack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.
